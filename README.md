# TRACK
TRACK is a small game.
Primitive graphics.
Little gameplay.
In fact, it is a learning experience.

# THE 'GAMEPLAY'
You hover your crosshair over squares.
They, which are 1 of 3 colours, will slowly turn white.
When they are white, they will disappear.
Once the current square has disappeared, a new one spawns.
You have to do this within a timer which starts at 5 seconds.
Each time you remove a square you have an extra 1/60 of a second to remove the next one.
